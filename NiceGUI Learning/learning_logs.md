## âœ… Day 1 Highlights:
- Created dynamic status labels using class inheritance (`status_label`).
- Explored hyperlink creation using `ui.link`, `ui.label`, and `ui.html`.
- Learned spacing tricks (`\u00A0`, `gap-x-0`) and in-text linking techniques.
- Used `ui.link_target` for internal page navigation.
- Embedded images inside links to create image buttons.
- Customized `ui.chat_message` with raw HTML, multi-line, and embedded elements.

## âœ… Day 2 Highlights:
- Understood the difference between **Python server-side** and **JavaScript client-side** event handlers, and how to use `emit()` to bridge them.
- Used `ui.element` and Tailwind classes like `p-2`, `bg-blue-100` for visual block elements.
- Learned to **move elements dynamically** (`.move()`) between cards or containers (label and card swapping).
- Structured responsive UIs using **`ui.row()` for horizontal alignment** and **`ui.column()` with `items-center`** for vertical stacking and centering.
- Practiced using `ui.card()` to wrap UI sections and create clean, component-based layouts.
