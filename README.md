My learning journey with NiceGUI, Thespian, DuckDB, uv-astral and agentic workflows

# 🧠 Agentic Desktop AI Learning Lab

This is my personal learning log as I explore and build agentic desktop applications using:

- 💻 [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) – Python-based GUI framework
- 🧵 [Thespian](https://thespianpy.com/) – Python actor model for concurrent agents
- 🐤 [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) – In-process SQL analytics engine
- ⚡ [uv (Astral)](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) – Fast Python package & environment manager
